# TicTacToe
Simple TicTacToe game made using Python 3.xx and AppJar

Note: Must have AppJar library added to Python 3.xx library folder to run the game. 

July 4th Update:
Re-worked most of the code to incorporate GUI. AppJar was used due to its simplicity.
Result of changes made:
 - Game board consists of 9 buttons labeled "1-9"
 - Added widget for tracking players score
 - Added ability to reset game board
 - 2 colors used, blue and pink, to show player turn


July 5th Update:
- Fixed the issue where "Player 1 turn" would stay blue instead of turning pink when reset button was pressed.
