# TicTacToe
Simple TicTacToe game made using Python and AppJar

July 4th Update:
Basically re-wrote 60% of the code in order to incorporate a GUI. I used AppJar to make the GUI due to its simplicity.
An idea came to mind as I was planning to make the GUI consist of:
  9 buttons for the game board
  1 button for resetting the score
  1 button for resetting the game board
  2 labels to display player scores
  1 label to display player turn with color
  
Took roughly 1 hour to redo the original tictactoe.py script to make a GUI using AppJar. Was quite fun! :D

July 5th Update:
- Fixed the issue where "Player 1 turn" would stay blue instead of turning pink when reset button was pressed.
